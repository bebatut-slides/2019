## How to reach the community of users?

Note:

PhD student studying impact of microbiota and sex in microglya aging (she)

- Generates data: RNA-seq, metagenomics, metabolomics, etc
- No bioinformatician in her group
- Heard about Galaxy via one of its colleague
- It could help her
- but no idea how to use it to analyze its data

----
