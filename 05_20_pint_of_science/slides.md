### And what about in humans?

Do you think we have more micro-organism cells or human cells in our own body?

<div class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">

- **10 times** more micro-organism cells than human cells
- More than **10,000** different microbe species in one human

How to identify organisms somewhere?

- Historically, cultivation
- only 10% can be cultivated

- Other solution? What do you in common with other living organisms?

---

DNA
- explain what is DNA
- DNA and phylogenetic tree
- can be used to identify all organisms somewhere (beer)

---

How can we know the DNA of something/someone?

Sequencing
- explain what is sequencing
- do they know some sequencing projects? companies?
- expand what you can investigate
- easy to do now and cheaper

---

Sequencing + microbiota
- beer
    - BeerDeCoded in Lausanne
    - Other publications??? silk road

---

Understand science + biology
- Fake news about sequencing, microbiota, etc (scientific police, etc)

---

Educate

StreetScienceCommunity
- BeerDEcoded
- No ethical issue
