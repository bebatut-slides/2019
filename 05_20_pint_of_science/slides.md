Note:

Need to change it probably

----

### Do you know where we can find micro-organisms?

1. beer
2. foetus
3. soil
4. vending machine

Note:

Make them vote for each image if there is micro-organisms

----

### And what about in humans?

The main view about micro-organisms in human

### And what about in humans?

But micro-organisms are mostly beneficial in humans

### And what about in humans?

Do you think we have more micro-organism cells or human cells in our own body?

<div class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">

- **10 times** more micro-organism cells than human cells
- More than **10,000** different microbe species in one human

### What about beer?

### How to identify micro-organisms?

![](images/timeline_1.png) <!-- .element width="100%" -->

Note:

- Historically, cultivation
- only 10% can be cultivated

----
### More than 90% of micro-organisms are unculturable

----
### Any other solution?

- How can we compare micro-organisms?
- What do you have in common with any other living organisms?
- What does make you different from your neighbor?

DNA
- explain what is DNA
- DNA and phylogenetic tree
- can be used to identify all organisms somewhere (beer)

How can we know the DNA of something/someone?

Sequencing
- explain what is sequencing
- do they know some sequencing projects? companies?
- expand what you can investigate
- easy to do now and cheaper

Sequencing + microbiota
- beer
    - BeerDeCoded in Lausanne
    - Other publications??? silk road

---

Understand science + biology
- Fake news about sequencing, microbiota, etc (scientific police, etc)

---

Educate

StreetScienceCommunity
- BeerDEcoded
- No ethical issue
